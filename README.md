## Extra

I installed a package called compodoc that maps/documents the project structure and details for easier investigation.
At the command prompt, type:

`npm run compodoc`

this generates all the needed documentation and serves it on `http://localhost:8080`

## Default Auto generated README

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
